Description: 'Two plots of the probability functions of the hypergeometric
              distribution (plotted as lines) vs. the binomial distribution (plotted as dots).
              The binomial distribution is a limiting form of the hypergeometric distribution,
              for sample sizes much smaller than population size. In that case, the binomial
              distribution can be used to approximate the hypergeometric distribution.'

Keywords: 'pdf, binomial, hypergeometric'
